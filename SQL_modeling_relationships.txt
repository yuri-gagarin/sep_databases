1. Create a database for the model we built in the example. Create SQL file taht creates the tables and inserts sample data (the questions below will help you create the data). Write queries applying the following scenarios:
    * Find a guest who exists in the database and has not booked a room.

    SELECT guests.first_name, guests.last_name
    FROM guests 
    LEFT JOIN bookings ON guests.id = bookings.guest_id
    WHERE bookings.guest_id IS NULL;

   
    * Find bookins for a guest who has booked two or morerooms for the same dates.

    my approach would be this:

    SELECT guests.first_name, bookings.check_in_date, COUNT(*) 
    FROM bookings  
    JOIN guests ON bookings.guest_id = guests.id 
    GROUP BY guests.first_name, bookings.check_in_date 
    HAVING count(*) > 1;

    this returns only guests who have booked more than one room on the same booking date. In my example, returns one guest who booked 4 rooms for the same check in date

     * Find bookings for a guest who has booked one room several times on different dates.

    SELECT DISTINCT guests.first_name, bookings.check_in_date
    FROM guests
    JOIN bookings ON guests.id = bookings.guest_id
    WHERE guests.first_name = 'Dave';

    this would return all past and current booking for Dave. The distinct clause would also filter out any duplicate bookings by Dave on the same dates

    * Count number of unique guests who have booked the same room;

    SELECT COUNT(*) AS "# of Guests Booked Same Room"
    FROM (
        SELECT DISTINCT guests.first_name
        FROM guests
        JOIN bookings ON guests.id = bookings.guest_id
        JOIN rooms ON bookings.room_id = rooms.id
        WHERE rooms.id = 9
    ) AS guests_in_same_room;

    ok so on this one i skipped ahead a bit and used a subquery. First I returned the unique names which booked a specific room in the past or future, in this case Room 9. Then with the COUNT() function returned the total names who booked Room 9

2. Design a data model for students and the classes they have taken. The model should include the students' grades for a given class.

3. Build a database for the students/classes data model. Create a SQL file that creates the tables and inserts sample data (the questions below will help you create the data). Write queries for the following data:
